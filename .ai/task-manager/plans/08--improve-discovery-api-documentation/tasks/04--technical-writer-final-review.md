# Technical Writer Final Review and Polish

## Objective

Conduct comprehensive technical writing review of all documentation additions to ensure professional quality, clarity, accuracy, completeness, and proper balance between conciseness and detail.

## Skills Required

- **technical-writing**: Expert-level technical documentation review, editing, and quality assurance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All documentation additions reviewed for clarity and readability
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout README.md
- [ ] JSON examples validated for syntax and accuracy
- [ ] Documentation accessible to both beginner and advanced developers
- [ ] Proper balance achieved between conciseness and completeness
- [ ] All code examples follow best practices
- [ ] Cross-references are helpful and accurate
- [ ] README length increase kept under 50% (per success criteria)
- [ ] Final approval from technical-writer agent

Use your internal Todo tool to track these and keep on track.

## Technical Requirements

**Review Scope:**

- API Reference section (Task 1)
- MCP Specification links (Task 2)
- Discovery workflow section (Task 3)
- Overall README.md coherence

**Quality Standards:**

- Clear, professional tone
- Consistent terminology (MCP tool vs JSON-RPC method, etc.)
- Valid JSON in all examples
- Practical, realistic examples
- Proper markdown formatting
- Logical information hierarchy

**Length Constraint:**

- Current README.md: ~226 lines
- Target: <339 lines (50% increase limit)
- Focus on value-dense content

## Input Dependencies

- Task 1: Completed API Reference section
- Task 2: Completed specification links integration
- Task 3: Completed discovery workflow enhancement
- Original README.md for comparison

## Output Artifacts

- Final polished README.md
- Documentation that enables developers to implement MCP clients without reading source code
- Professional-quality API reference suitable for public release

## Implementation Notes

### Step 1: Comprehensive Review Checklist

Use technical-writer agent to systematically review:

**Content Quality:**

- [ ] Clear purpose and audience for each section
- [ ] Logical flow and organization
- [ ] Appropriate level of detail for each topic
- [ ] No redundant or conflicting information
- [ ] Examples are practical and realistic

**Technical Accuracy:**

- [ ] All endpoint URLs and methods correct
- [ ] Parameter names and types match implementation
- [ ] Error codes match McpToolsController
- [ ] Pagination logic accurately described
- [ ] Security model correctly explained

**Writing Quality:**

- [ ] Professional, clear tone throughout
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive
- [ ] Concise sentences without unnecessary words
- [ ] Proper grammar and punctuation
- [ ] Consistent style and formatting

**Terminology Consistency:**

- [ ] "MCP tool" vs "tool" usage consistent
- [ ] "JSON-RPC method" terminology consistent
- [ ] "Endpoint" vs "route" vs "URL" consistent
- [ ] "Client" vs "consumer" consistent
- [ ] Technical terms properly introduced

### Step 2: Validate All JSON Examples

For each JSON example in documentation:

```bash
# Extract and validate each JSON block
echo '{"tools": [...], "nextCursor": null}' | jq . >/dev/null && echo "Valid" || echo "Invalid"
```

Ensure:

- [ ] Syntactically valid JSON
- [ ] Matches actual endpoint responses
- [ ] Uses realistic data (not just placeholders)
- [ ] Properly formatted with consistent indentation

### Step 3: Cross-Reference Verification

Check all internal references:

- [ ] "See API Reference section" links work
- [ ] Specification URLs are accessible
- [ ] Code file references are accurate (e.g., McpToolsController.php)
- [ ] Table of contents (if added) is correct

### Step 4: Readability Assessment

Evaluate for different audiences:

**For Beginners:**

- [ ] Concepts introduced before use
- [ ] Examples progress from simple to complex
- [ ] Technical jargon explained or avoided
- [ ] Clear guidance on getting started

**For Advanced Users:**

- [ ] Complete technical details available
- [ ] Links to deeper resources (MCP spec)
- [ ] Edge cases and advanced scenarios covered
- [ ] Efficient navigation to relevant sections

### Step 5: Length and Conciseness Review

Check documentation length:

```bash
# Count lines in README.md
wc -l README.md

# Target: <339 lines (50% increase from ~226)
```

If over limit, prioritize removing:

- Redundant explanations
- Excessive examples (keep 1-2 best ones)
- Verbose transitions
- Unnecessary sections

**Preserve:**

- Critical technical details
- Practical examples
- Clear navigation/structure

### Step 6: Code Example Best Practices

Review all code examples for:

**Shell/Curl Examples:**

- [ ] Use proper quoting
- [ ] Include necessary headers
- [ ] Show realistic URLs (https://your-site.com pattern)
- [ ] Include helpful comments
- [ ] Demonstrate actual use cases

**JSON Examples:**

- [ ] 2-space indentation
- [ ] Trailing commas removed
- [ ] Comments excluded (invalid in JSON)
- [ ] Realistic field values

**PHP Examples:**

- [ ] Follow Drupal coding standards
- [ ] Include necessary use statements
- [ ] Show complete, working code
- [ ] Include helpful inline comments

### Step 7: Final Polish Pass

**Markdown Formatting:**

- [ ] Headers properly nested (H2 → H3 → H4)
- [ ] Code blocks have language hints
- [ ] Lists use consistent bullet style
- [ ] Tables properly formatted
- [ ] Emphasis (bold/italic) used appropriately

**Navigation:**

- [ ] Logical section order
- [ ] Clear section transitions
- [ ] Helpful cross-references
- [ ] Consider adding TOC if length justifies

**Visual Elements:**

- [ ] Code blocks properly fenced
- [ ] Blockquotes used for notes/tips
- [ ] Spacing enhances readability
- [ ] Consistent visual hierarchy

### Step 8: Accessibility Check

Ensure documentation is accessible:

- [ ] Alt text for images (if any)
- [ ] Clear link text (not "click here")
- [ ] Proper semantic structure
- [ ] Readable without styling

### Step 9: Technical Writer Agent Review

Submit complete README.md to technical-writer agent with specific review request:

```markdown
Please review this README.md documentation for:

1. Professional technical writing quality
2. Clarity and accessibility to different skill levels
3. Consistency in terminology and style
4. Proper balance of conciseness and completeness
