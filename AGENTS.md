‚ö†Ô∏è **READ THIS FIRST - CHECK BEFORE EVERY ACTION** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This file contains CRITICAL instructions that MUST be followed in ALL interactions.
These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and take precedence over global instructions.

# üö® MANDATORY PRE-ACTION CHECKLIST üö®

Before taking ANY action (commits, PRs, file creation, etc.), verify:
‚úÖ Does this violate any instruction below?
‚úÖ Am I about to attribute AI involvement anywhere?
‚úÖ Am I creating unnecessary files?
‚úÖ Am I doing more than requested?

# AI Attribution - ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION

- **NEVER EVER** attribute any code, message, or any other part of the repo, or associated metadata, was generated by an AI
- This includes:
  - Git commits (no "Generated with Claude", no "Co-Authored-By: Claude", etc.)
  - GitHub issue descriptions
  - GitHub PRs
  - Code comments
  - Documentation
  - ANY metadata that gets committed to the repository
- **NO DDEV REFERENCES**: Never add ddev-specific paths, commands, or references to the module codebase. The module must remain environment-agnostic and work in any Drupal installation
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - These rules apply to ALL content that becomes part of the repository

# File Creation Policy - STRICT MINIMALISM

- **NEVER** create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving the specific goal
- **ALWAYS** prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- **NEVER** proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation files if **explicitly requested** by the user
- When in doubt, ask before creating any new file

# Scope Control - DO EXACTLY WHAT'S ASKED

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- Do not add "helpful" extras unless specifically requested
- Do not anticipate future needs
- Stay focused on the immediate task
